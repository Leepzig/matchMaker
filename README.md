# MatchMaker

MatchMaker is an application where you can make a profile and see other people's profiles and hopefully find your match.  Your matches are based off who you are interested in.

## Set up

To use, just clone the repo and then run `yarn start` to spin up the react server and `yarn startup` to spin up the json server.
